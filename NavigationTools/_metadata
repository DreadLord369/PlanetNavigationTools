  "description" : "[h1]Origin[/h1]\nCredit for the initial creation of this mod goes to catalytic over at the ChuckleFish forums.\nLink to original mod: https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/planet-navigation-tools.5539/\n\n\n[h1]Changes from the original:[/h1]\n[list][*]No longer requires holding the minimap in order for it to be mapping out your environment. (The minimap item is now purely a tool to open the minimap)\n\n[*]Minimap now scans in a larger circle around the player for a more convenient mapping experience\n\n[*]Reworked visual aspects\n\n[*]Added compatibility for Stardust Core Lite to add a menu item if you prefer not to use a map item. [b][i](Highly recommended)[/i][/b]\n\n[*]Added death markers - any time you die, a marker will be created at that location with the time recorded. You can then see (in play time) how long ago you died there, and more easily find your way to your dropped loot.\n\n[*]Added a new button to the minimap to quickly clear all death markers on the current world [i][strike]in case you suffer from chronic deaths syndrome[/strike][/i]\n\n[*]Adjusted recipes for the 3 items to be attainable earlier in the game.\n\n[*]Added larger expanded view of minimap to allow for viewing more at once. CAUTION: THIS LARGER MAP VIEW WILL DROP YOUR FRAMERATE WHEN USED[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Description: [b][i]See original mod link above for more info[/i][/b][/h1]\nMap out planets as you explore and mark locations of interest using the survey compass, the surface charter, or the minimap.\n\n\n[h1]Found a Bug/Issue?:[/h1]\nPlease raise an Issue via the GitHub page for the mod: https://github.com/DreadLord369/PlanetNavigationTools\nPlease be sure to provide your starbound.log file (located in your Starbound Install folder under \"\\storage\\starbound.log\") and as many details as possible to help in figuring out the cause of the issue.\n\n\n[h1]Known Issues:[/h1]\n[list][*]There are currently no known issues[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Notes:[/h1]\nAside from a minor visual adjustment and compatibility update, the surface mapper tool and the survey compass tool have not been changed from the original mod, and will likely not be changed in this version of the mod.",
