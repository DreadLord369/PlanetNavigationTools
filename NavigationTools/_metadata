  "description" : "[h1]Origin[/h1]\nCredit for the initial creation of this mod goes to catalytic over at the ChuckleFish forums.\nLink to original mod: https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/planet-navigation-tools.5539/\n\n\n[h1]Changes from the original:[/h1]\n[list][*]No longer requires holding the minimap in order for it to be mapping out your environment. (The minimap item is now purely a tool to open the minimap)\n\n[*]Reworked visual aspects\n\n[*]Added compatibility for Stardust Core Lite to add a menu item if you prefer not to use a map item. [b][i](Highly recommended)[/i][/b]\n\n[*]Added death markers - any time you die, a marker will be created at that location with the time recorded. You can then see (in play time) how long ago you died there, and more easily find your way to your dropped loot.\n\n[*]Added a new button to the minimap to quickly clear all death markers on the current world [i][strike]in case you suffer from chronic deaths syndrome[/strike][/i]\n\n[*]Adjusted recipes for the 3 items to be attainable earlier in the game.[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Description: [b][i]See original mod link above for more info[/i][/b][/h1]\nMap out planets as you explore and mark locations of interest using the survey compass, the surface charter, or the minimap.\n\n\n[h1]Found a Bug/Issue?:[/h1]\nPlease be sure to provide your starbound.log file (located in your Starbound Install folder under \"\\storage\\starbound.log\").\nAn easy way to share this file is to copy its contents into pastebin.com, and provide the link.\nThis will help me figure out what may be the cause of the issue.\n\n\n[h1]Known Issues:[/h1]\n[list][*]Death by starvation is not captured as a death marker.\n[i]* This seems to be the one type of death that is immune to being captured. I will keep trying to find a way though[/i]\n\n[*]The game may crash if the minimap is open when teleporting.\n[i]* This is fixed in most cases as it will automatically close when teleporting, then reopen when you finish teleporting. However, there are still rare instances when the \"finish teleporting\" part is triggered too soon and the game crashes. (cannot be accounted for in all cases due to the limitation of scripting access). I have implemented a delay before reopening, but I may look to change this to simply close on teleport and require manually opening the map if needed after the teleport.[/i][/list]\n\n\n[h1]Notes:[/h1]\nAside from a minor visual adjustment, the surface mapper tool and the survey compass tool have not been changed from the original mod, and will likely not be changed in this version of the mod.",
