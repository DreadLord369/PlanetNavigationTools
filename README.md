# PlanetNavigationTools

Planet Navigation Tools add 3 new items to the game:
* Survey Compass
* Surface Map
* Minimap

### Survey Compass
The Survey Compass is a basic tool that simply provides distance to any of your markers on your current planet.

### Surface Map
The Surface Map provides a little more inforamation in the way of a 1D view of the surface height. This is mapped out as you travel along the surface of the planet. This uses an outated technology, and so is succeptible to issues with mapping when there are obstacles between you and the surface of the planet.

### Minimap
The Minimap uses the latest technology to provide a 2D visual depiction of your current planet. This is mapped out as you move around in your planet and has been incorporated into your quick bar (requires Stardust Core Lite in order to use the quick bar option).

In addition, most of your deaths will be recorded (unfortunately if you starve to death, you're at your own mercy), allowing for easier retrieval of lost items through the use of the Minimap.
